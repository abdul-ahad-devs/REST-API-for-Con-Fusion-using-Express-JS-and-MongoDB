# REST-API-for-Con-Fusion-using-Express-JS-and-MongoDB
This the a REST API for Ristorante ConFusion built on Express JS and MongoDB

This is the REST API for a full fledged React website Ristorante ConFusion recently uploaded by me on 

https://github.com/dark-theme-programmer/Ristorante-ConFusion-UI-Design-on-React_Redux-js.git


I have built this REST API with the following features:

1.) First of all, an express generator was setup.
2.) A number of different routes have been implemented using the latest knowledge of JavaScript
3.) Different modals and schema were built in order to integrate respective routes with Mongo DB
4.) User authentication was implemented using passport-local and passport-jwt
5.) For authorized login, passport-facebook-token was also used in order to authorize users throught their facebook accounts
6.) For hashing the passwords of the users accounts, the middleware express-session was implemented

A simple but producitve REST API is successfully built and this API is under development to increase its number of features.

#Atlast, this is my first ever REST API built on Node JS and Express JS
